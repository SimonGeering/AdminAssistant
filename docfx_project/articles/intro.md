## Overview

The system is intended to act as a personal information management system, assisting with the admin of day to day life for an individual handling home finances and running a household along with day to day operation of a "side project" small business venture.

### A note on technologies used

Note that the intent of the project is to show a range of technologies. As such, while the architecture is realistic there may be an excessive number of project types in use in order to highlight a number of possible approaches.  

For example, the project includes multiple versions of the same UI using various UI platforms such as Desktop, Mobile or various Web technologies, where a real-world system may only utilise a subset of these.
